Task: Network Traffic Capture and Analysis using Wireshark

1. INTRODUCTION

This practical exercise was conducted to learn how to capture, filter, and analyze network packets using Wireshark, a widely used network protocol analyzer. The goal was to generate network traffic, identify different protocols, and summarize the packet details.

2. Steps Performed

STEP 1 – START CAPTURE

Wireshark was opened, and the active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) was selected.

Packet capturing was started by clicking the capture icon.

STEP 2 – GENERATE TRAFFIC

A website (example.com) was opened in the browser.

A ping google.com command was also executed to create additional network traffic.

STEP 3 – STOP CAPTURE

After approximately 1 minute, the capture process was stopped to analyze the recorded packets.

STEP 4 – FILTER PACKETS BY PROTOCOL

Filters were applied to view specific traffic types:

http → showed website browsing traffic


dns → showed domain resolution queries

tcp → showed underlying transport protocol packets

STEP 5 – IDENTIFY PROTOCOLS

At least three different protocols were identified in the capture:

DNS – Resolving domain names like google.com.

HTTP – Web traffic from browsing.

TCP – Transport-level communication for reliable data transfer.

STEP 6 – EXPORT CAPTURE

The captured traffic was exported as a .pcap file
